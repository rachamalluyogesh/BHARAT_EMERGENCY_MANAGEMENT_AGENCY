<p><strong>Know Your Hurricane Risk</strong></p>



<p>Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem. Find out how rain, wind, water and even tornadoes could happen far inland from where a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrn/2020-determine-your-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">Start preparing now</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Make an Emergency Plan</strong></p>



<p>Make sure everyone in your household knows and understands&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">your hurricane plans</a>. Include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/plan-for-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">office, kids’ day care, and anywhere else you frequent</a> in your hurricane plans. Ensure your business has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">continuity plan</a>&nbsp;to continue operating when disaster strikes.</p>



<p><strong>Know your Evacuation Zone</strong></p>



<p>You may have to evacuate quickly due to a hurricane if you live in an evacuation zone.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/evacuation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">Learn your evacuation routes</a>, practice with your household and pets, and identify where you will stay.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Follow the instructions from local emergency managers, who work closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies and partners. They will provide the latest recommendations based on the threat to your community and appropriate safety measures.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Recognize Warnings and Alerts</strong></p>



<p>Have several ways to receive alerts.<a href="****" class="survey-processed">&nbsp;Download the our app</a>&nbsp;and receive&nbsp;real-time alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations nationwide.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">Sign up for community alerts</a>&nbsp;in your area and be aware of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA), which require no sign up.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Those with Disabilities</strong></p>



<p>Identify if you may need additional help during an emergency if you or anyone else in your household is an <a href="https://www.ready.gov/disability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">individual with a disability</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Review Important Documents</strong></p>



<p>Make sure your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/financial-preparedness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">insurance policies and personal documents</a>,&nbsp;such as ID, are up to date. Make copies and keep them in a secure password-protected digital space.</p>



<p><strong>Strengthen your Home</strong></p>



<p>De-clutter drains and gutters, bring in outside furniture, and consider hurricane shutters.</p>



<p><strong>Get Tech Ready</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.ready.gov/get-tech-ready" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">Keep your cell phone charged</a>&nbsp;when you know a hurricane is in the forecast and purchase backup charging devices to power electronics.</p>



<p><strong>Help your Neighborhood</strong></p>



<p>Check with neighbors,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/seniors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">senior adults</a>, or those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/disability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">who may need additional help</a>&nbsp;securing hurricane plans to see how you can be of assistance to others</p>



<p><strong>Gather Supplies</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.ready.gov/kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">Have enough supplies</a>&nbsp;for your household, include medication, disinfectant supplies and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/pets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">pet supplies</a>&nbsp;in your go bag or car trunk. You may not have access to these supplies for days or even weeks after a hurricane.</p>

<div class="wp-block-fema-checklist checklist_fema"><div class="checklist_fema_blocks">
<ul><li>Determine how best to protect yourself from high winds and flooding.</li><li>Take refuge in a designated storm shelter or an interior room for high winds.</li><li>Go to the highest level of the building if you are trapped by flooding. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising flood water.</li><li>Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown! Just six inches of fast-moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.</li></ul>

People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/clinicians_asthma.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="survey-processed">asthma and other lung conditions</a>&nbsp;and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled, even if these individuals are not allergic to mold. Children should not help with disaster cleanup work.</li><li>Wear protective clothing and work with someone else.</li><li>Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off electricity at the main breaker or fuse box to prevent electric shock.</li><li>Do not wade in flood water, which can contain dangerous pathogens that cause illnesses. This water also can contain debris, chemicals, waste and wildlife. Underground or downed power lines also can electrically charge the water.</li><li>Save phone calls for emergencies. Phone systems often are down or busy after a disaster. Use text messages or social media to communicate with family and friends.</li><li>Document any property damage with photographs. Contact your insurance company for assistance.</li></ul>
